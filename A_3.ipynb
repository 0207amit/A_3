    "\n",
    "### 2. Reusability: \n",
    "Once we've defined a function to perform a specific task, we can reuse that function in different parts of your program or even in different programs altogether.\n",

    "### 3. Readability: \n",
    "Well-named functions make our code more readable and self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Abstraction: \n",
    "Functions abstract away the details of how a certain task is performed. This means that we can use a function without needing to know the intricate implementation details. This abstraction allows you to focus on the higher-level logic of your program.\n",
